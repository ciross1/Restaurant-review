Elasticsearch

What it is:
Elasticsearch is a search engine and analytics database. It stores large amounts of structured and unstructured data in a way that makes searching very fast.

Key points:

Built on Lucene (a powerful search library).

Stores data as JSON documents.

Can index, search, and aggregate data in real time.

Often used for logs, metrics, product catalogs, or anything where fast search matters.

Example in your app:
Your restaurant reviews could be stored in Elasticsearch. You could then search for:

Restaurants by name, cuisine, or location.

Reviews containing certain keywords.

Aggregate data like average ratings.

Kibana

What it is:
Kibana is a visualization and dashboard tool for Elasticsearch.
It doesn’t store data; it reads from Elasticsearch and lets you explore, visualize, and analyze data.

Key points:

Create dashboards, charts, and graphs.

Filter, sort, and drill down into data quickly.

Often used for log monitoring, analytics, or any data stored in Elasticsearch.

Example in your app:
You could build dashboards showing:

Most reviewed restaurants.

Average ratings over time.

Keyword trends in reviews.

3. How they combine

Elasticsearch stores the data

Example: restaurant reviews, ratings, user activity.

Kibana reads the data from Elasticsearch

You can build dashboards or visual queries without touching your database directly.

Workflow example:

A user posts a review → data is indexed in Elasticsearch.

Kibana dashboard updates → shows trending restaurants or top-rated dishes.
