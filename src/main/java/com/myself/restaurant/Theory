ELASTICSEARCH: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What it is: A search and analytics engine.

Think of it as: A super-fast database optimized for searching, filtering, and analyzing huge amounts of data.

Use cases:

Searching text (like Google search for your website)

Storing logs or metrics

Analyzing large datasets in real time

Example:
You have a database of restaurants. Elasticsearch can quickly answer:

“Find all restaurants in New York with a rating above 4.5”

“Show the top 10 most popular dishes in the last month”



KIBANA--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What it is: A web-based interface/dashboard for Elasticsearch.

Think of it as: A “front-end” to see, explore, and visualize your Elasticsearch data.

Use cases:

Create charts, graphs, and maps of your data

Analyze trends visually

Search and filter your data easily

Example:
With the restaurant data in Elasticsearch, Kibana can show:

A map of all restaurants by location

A bar chart of average ratings

Real-time updates on new restaurants being added





KEYCLOAK---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What it is: An identity and access management (IAM) system.

Think of it as: A tool to manage users, logins, and permissions.

Use cases:

Login for websites or apps

Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple apps

Managing roles and access permissions

Example:

Users log in to your restaurant management app through Keycloak.

Admins can control who can add, edit, or delete restaurants.
